 # Weather  Application

This is my fourth project from Free Code Camp which has the following User Stories :

* I can see the weather in my current location.

* I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

* I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
